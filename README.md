#  Tesla Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

A deep learning project that implements a sequential LSTM-based model to predict Tesla stock prices using historical market data. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, performance evaluation, and hyperparameter optimization.

##  Project Overview

- Developed a **sequential deep learning model** using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks** to predict **Tesla (TSLA) stock prices** based on historical market data.
- Integrated **data visualization techniques** including moving averages, correlation heatmaps, and trend plots for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and result interpretation.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**, **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**, and **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**, achieving strong predictive accuracy on test data.
- Optimized the model architecture through **hyperparameter tuning**, adjusting parameters such as the number of LSTM layers, units per layer, batch size, and learning rate for improved performance.
